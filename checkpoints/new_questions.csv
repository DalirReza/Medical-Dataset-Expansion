Would there be any studies available? Could anyone give some insight into what could be causing this problem in her mouth? Is there any interest in researching her case? Thank you.,"a friend of mine has been having chemotherapy for breast cancer, she has developed a foam in her mouth that seems to be coming from her gums, she has been to every doctor but no one has been able to diagnose her, she has tried everything that has been recommended and nothing seems to work, she has fallen into a deep depression because of this constant foaming. Are there any studies available? Can anyone give any insight into what could be causing this problem in her mouth? Are you interested in looking into her case? Thanks"
