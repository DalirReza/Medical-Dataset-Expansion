# Medical-Dataset-Expansion
This project improves medical question summarization by expanding the MEQSUM dataset using Round-Trip Translation and advanced selection methods (FQD, PRQD, QSV). Pre-trained models like BART, T5, and DeepSeek generate summaries, ensuring accuracy and diversity for better medical information retrieval.
