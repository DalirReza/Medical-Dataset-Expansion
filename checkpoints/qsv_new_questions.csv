122,"hello, my name is name. I started taking Tecfedera as prescribed sometime in April. I started on the 12th dose and immediately experienced redness and swelling of my lips and nose. I called my doctor. He said this is not unusual. I take an aspirin tablet with each dose. I took it and it seemed to subside. I started taking the full dose every day. My pain increased after a few weeks. The pain I usually had during sudden flare-ups had now multiplied to an unbearable level. I stopped taking Tecfedera. Unfortunately, the pain did not subside. To this day, my pain level is at its maximum.
